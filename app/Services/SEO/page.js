            <p className="text-justify text-sm md:text-base xl:text-lg mt-2">
              On-page optimization involves optimizing various elements on your

              optimizing meta tags (title tags, meta descriptions), heading
              tags, URL structure, and incorporating targeted keywords naturally
              within your content. Ensure your website has well-structured,

              Building high-quality backlinks from reputable and relevant
